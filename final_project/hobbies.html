                <p>Groundhogs truly hibernate. Bears are “pseudo-hibernators,” as their winter body temperature 
                    remains at near normal levels, while the groundhog’s falls to 40 degrees. 
                    They would freeze if their burrows were not below the frost line. Normal 
                    temperature of a groundhog is 100 degrees, but will gradually drop as low as 37 degrees. 
                    In this coma-like state, the groundhog is more dead than alive and will not wake if touched.</p>

                <h2>Winter into Spring: Predictin' time</h2>
                <p>According to popular folklore a groundhog can predict winter’s end by emerging from hibernation on February 2 
                    and going back to sleep for six weeks if it sees its shadow. In reality it is too early for spring in this part 
                    of the country (Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania) where the publicity about Groundhog Day started. 
                    The majority of males come out of their burrows in mid- to late February; females appear from late February to mid-March.</p>
                    <h1>Spring and Summer</h1>

                    <h2>Spring: Lovin' time</h2>
                    <p>Mating takes place in late February through March. The period from mid-March through April 
                        is a time of ravenous appetite and activity, as groundhogs hurry to mate and raise a litter by June. 
                        The young must have enough time to prepare for hibernation. Babies born after the end of April have 
                        little chance to survive the winter. That is why the breeding season is so short. 
                        Thirty to thirty-two days after conception, three to six groundhog kits are born.</p>

                    <h2>Summer into Early Fall: <br>Time to get fat!</h2>
                        <p>In early June, the groundhogs' metabolism slows; food intake also decreases, but 
                            their weight increases by 100 percent. July is a hyperactive period of greatest weight gain; 
                            metabolism slows and food is converted to body fat in preparation for hibernation. 
                            Most of the groundhogs' energy goes to producing the fat deposits on which they will live during hibernation 
                            and after emerging from their burrows in late winter when fresh grass and vegetables are not available. 
                            In September, ten days to two weeks before going underground for hibernation, the groundhog stops eating 
                            and slowly enters hibernation.</p>
